    "Thresholding is a technique in OpenCV, which is the assignment of pixel values in relation to the threshold value provided. In thresholding, each pixel value is compared with the threshold value.\n",

    "\n",
    "cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV: Inverted or Opposite case of cv2.THRESH_BINARY.\n",
    "\n",
    "cv.THRESH_TRUNC: If pixel intensity value is greater than threshold, it is truncated to the threshold. The pixel values are set to be the same as the threshold. All other values remain the same.\n",

    "cv.THRESH_TOZERO: Pixel intensity is set to 0, for all the pixels intensity, less than the threshold value.\n",
